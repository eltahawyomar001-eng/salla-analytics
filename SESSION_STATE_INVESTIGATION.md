# üîß Session State Persistence Investigation

## The Problem

User uploads and analyzes data successfully, but when navigating to other pages (Executive Summary, Financial Insights, etc.), the app shows:
```
"No analysis results available. Please upload and process data first."
```

The data/file appears to get "auto removed" when navigating between pages.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis 1: data_loaded Flag Not Persisting ‚ùì
- `data_loaded` is set to `True` at end of analysis (upload.py line 546)
- `data_loaded` is checked by all analysis pages (summary.py line 18)
- **Issue**: When new file uploaded, `analysis_results` was cleared but `data_loaded` wasn't set to False
- **Fix Applied**: Added `st.session_state.data_loaded = False` when clearing state

### Hypothesis 2: Session State Being Cleared on Navigation ‚ùì
- Streamlit session state SHOULD persist across page navigations
- Need to verify session state is actually persisting

### Hypothesis 3: Something Triggering File Clear Logic ‚ùì
- File clear logic runs when: `'df_raw' not in st.session_state or st.session_state.get('current_file') != uploaded_file.name`
- When navigating away from Upload page, `uploaded_file` is None
- But this shouldn't trigger clear because we're checking `current_file` match, not None

## Debug Changes Made

### 1. Fixed data_loaded Flag
**File**: `app/ui/pages/upload.py` (Line 83)

```python
# Clear old mappings and analysis results
if 'analysis_results' in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.analysis_results = {}
# NEW: Clear data_loaded flag when new file uploaded
st.session_state.data_loaded = False
```

**Why**: When uploading a NEW file, we clear analysis results, so we should also clear the data_loaded flag. Otherwise `data_loaded=True` from previous file but `analysis_results={}` (empty).

### 2. Added Debug Panel to Summary Page
**File**: `app/ui/pages/summary.py` (Lines 16-22)

```python
# Debug: Show session state status
with st.expander("üîß Debug: Session State", expanded=False):
    st.write(f"**data_loaded**: {st.session_state.get('data_loaded', 'NOT SET')}")
    st.write(f"**analysis_results keys**: {list(st.session_state.get('analysis_results', {}).keys())}")
    st.write(f"**df_clean exists**: {'df_clean' in st.session_state}")
    st.write(f"**current_file**: {st.session_state.get('current_file', 'NOT SET')}")
```

**Why**: This will show us EXACTLY what's in session state when you navigate to the summary page. This will help diagnose if:
- `data_loaded` is actually False
- `analysis_results` is empty {}
- `df_clean` was deleted
- `current_file` name changed

## Testing Steps

### App Status:
üöÄ **Running at**: http://localhost:8501

### Test Procedure:

1. **Upload and Analyze Data**
   - Go to Upload page
   - Upload file (Salla, Germany, or E Commerce Dashboard)
   - Complete column mapping
   - Click "Process Data"
   - Wait for analysis to complete
   - Should see: "‚úÖ Analysis complete! Navigate to other pages to see insights"

2. **Navigate to Executive Summary**
   - Click on "Executive Summary" in sidebar
   - **Check the debug panel** (üîß Debug: Session State)
   - Take note of what it shows:
     - Is `data_loaded` True or False?
     - Are `analysis_results keys` populated or empty []?
     - Does `df_clean` exist?
     - Is `current_file` set?

3. **If Data Not Available**:
   - The debug panel will show what's missing
   - Report back what values you see

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Working Scenario:
```
1. Upload file ‚Üí Analysis completes
2. Navigate to Summary
3. Debug shows:
   - data_loaded: True ‚úÖ
   - analysis_results keys: ['kpis', 'rfm', 'cohorts', 'products', 'anomalies'] ‚úÖ
   - df_clean exists: True ‚úÖ
   - current_file: "filename.xlsx" ‚úÖ
4. Summary page displays metrics ‚úÖ
```

### ‚ùå Broken Scenario (what we're investigating):
```
1. Upload file ‚Üí Analysis completes
2. Navigate to Summary
3. Debug shows:
   - data_loaded: False ‚ùå (or NOT SET)
   - analysis_results keys: [] ‚ùå (empty)
   - df_clean exists: False ‚ùå
   - current_file: NOT SET ‚ùå
4. Summary page shows "No analysis results" ‚ùå
```

## Possible Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Session State Not Persisting (Browser Issue)
**Symptom**: Debug shows all values as NOT SET or empty
**Cause**: Browser might be starting new session on navigation
**Solution**: 
- Try using Chrome/Edge instead of other browsers
- Clear browser cache
- Use Incognito/Private mode

### Issue 2: File Cleared on New Upload
**Symptom**: Debug shows data_loaded=False after uploading NEW file over old one
**Cause**: Working as intended - new file should clear old analysis
**Solution**: Re-analyze the new file

### Issue 3: Memory Issue with Large Files
**Symptom**: Session state exists but df_clean is None
**Cause**: Streamlit might be clearing large dataframes
**Solution**: 
- Check RAM usage
- May need to implement data caching strategy

### Issue 4: Race Condition
**Symptom**: Intermittent - sometimes works, sometimes doesn't
**Cause**: Analysis not fully completing before navigation
**Solution**: Wait for all progress bars to finish before navigating

## Next Steps

1. **Upload a file and complete analysis**
2. **Navigate to Executive Summary**
3. **Open the "üîß Debug: Session State" expander**
4. **Report back what you see**

This will tell us exactly what's happening and where the data is being lost!

## Known Issues Found

During testing, found a separate error in Financial Insights page:
```
ValueError: Value of 'x' is not the name of a column in 'data_frame'. 
Expected one of [] but received: effort_level
```

This is a DIFFERENT issue (empty dataframe in matrix calculation) and should be fixed separately.
