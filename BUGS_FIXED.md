# âœ… BUGS FIXED - Ready for Testing

## Export Error - FIXED âœ…

**Error:** `The truth value of a DataFrame is ambiguous. Use a.empty, a.bool()...`

**Root Cause:** Line 496 in workbook.py checked `if 'order_date' in df_clean.columns` without checking if DataFrame had rows first.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before (causes error):
'Date Range', f"{df_clean['order_date'].min()} to {df_clean['order_date'].max()}" if 'order_date' in df_clean.columns else 'N/A'

# After (works correctly):
'Date Range', f"{df_clean['order_date'].min()} to {df_clean['order_date'].max()}" if 'order_date' in df_clean.columns and len(df_clean) > 0 else 'N/A'
```

**Test:** Go to Summary page â†’ Click "Download Excel Report" â†’ Should generate file successfully

## Financial Insights Page Crash - FIXED âœ…

**Error:** `KeyError: 'customers'`

**Root Cause:** Mismatch between dictionary keys - analytics module returned `customer_count` but UI page expected `customers`.

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **In financial_insights.py** (line 433-441):
   - Added both `customer_count` and `customers` keys for compatibility
   - Added safety checks for empty priority lists

2. **In financial_insights.py** (line 454-459):
   - Changed `top_priorities[0]['customers']` to `top_priorities[0]['customer_count']`
   - Added `if len(top_priorities) > 0` checks to prevent index errors
   - Added fallback messages when no data available

3. **In financial_insights.py** (_generate_90_day_plan):
   - Added empty list handling
   - Added length checks before accessing array indices

**Test:** Go to "ðŸ’° Financial Insights" page â†’ Should load without errors and show recommendations
