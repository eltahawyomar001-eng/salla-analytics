üéØ RFM ANALYSIS EXPLAINED
==============================

WHAT IS RFM?
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, Monetary - the three key ways to measure customers:

üìÖ RECENCY: How recently did they buy?
   ‚Ä¢ Calculation: Days since their last purchase (today's date minus last order date)
   ‚Ä¢ Example: Customer last bought on Oct 1st, today is Oct 13th = 12 days recency
   ‚Ä¢ Why it matters: Recent buyers are 5x more likely to buy again within 30 days
   ‚Ä¢ Good score: 0-30 days (recent and engaged)
   ‚Ä¢ Bad score: 180+ days (very old, likely lost)
   ‚Ä¢ Business action: Contact customers who haven't bought in 60+ days with special offers

üîÑ FREQUENCY: How often do they buy?
   ‚Ä¢ Calculation: Count of total separate orders per customer (not quantity in orders)
   ‚Ä¢ Example: Customer made purchases on 5 different dates = frequency score 5
   ‚Ä¢ Why it matters: Frequent buyers show loyalty and predict future purchases
   ‚Ä¢ Good score: 3+ orders (showing repeat behavior and loyalty)
   ‚Ä¢ Bad score: 1 order only (one-time buyer, high churn risk)
   ‚Ä¢ Business action: Reward frequent buyers with loyalty programs, encourage one-time buyers to return

üí∞ MONETARY: How much do they spend IN SAUDI RIYALS (SAR)?
   ‚Ä¢ Calculation: Sum of ALL order values per customer across their entire history
   ‚Ä¢ Example: Customer made 3 orders: 100 SAR + 250 SAR + 150 SAR = 500 SAR total monetary value
   ‚Ä¢ Why it matters: High spenders typically generate 80% of your revenue (Pareto principle)
   ‚Ä¢ Good score: Top 20% of total spending in your customer base
   ‚Ä¢ Bad score: Bottom 20% of spending (low lifetime value)
   ‚Ä¢ Business action: Upsell high spenders with premium products, create bundles for low spenders

YOUR BUSINESS RFM RANGES (in Saudi Riyals - SAR):
   ‚Ä¢ Recency: 31 - 692 days
   ‚Ä¢ Frequency: 1 - 24 orders
   ‚Ä¢ Monetary: 0.21 SAR - 14461.00 SAR
   ‚Ä¢ Average Order Value: 0.21 SAR - 5940.00 SAR

üìä DETAILED CALCULATION EXPLANATIONS:
==================================================

üî¢ RECENCY CALCULATION:
RECENCY DETAILED CALCULATION:
   ‚Ä¢ How calculated: Days between customer's last purchase and TODAY'S analysis date (2025-10-13)
   ‚Ä¢ Formula: Today's Date - Last Purchase Date = Days Since Last Purchase
   ‚Ä¢ Example: If customer last bought on 2025-09-01 and analysis date is 2025-10-13, recency = 42 days
   ‚Ä¢ Latest order in your data: 2025-09-11
   ‚Ä¢ Why it matters: Recent buyers are 5x more likely to purchase again
   ‚Ä¢ Scoring: Lower days = Higher score (5=bought recently, 1=bought long ago)

üî¢ FREQUENCY CALCULATION:
FREQUENCY DETAILED CALCULATION:
   ‚Ä¢ How calculated: Count total number of separate orders per customer
   ‚Ä¢ Formula: COUNT(orders per customer_id)
   ‚Ä¢ Example: Customer A made orders on 3 different dates = frequency score 3
   ‚Ä¢ Range in your data: 1 to 24 orders
   ‚Ä¢ Why it matters: Shows customer loyalty and repeat behavior
   ‚Ä¢ Scoring: More orders = Higher score (5=very loyal, 1=one-time buyer)

üî¢ MONETARY CALCULATION:
MONETARY DETAILED CALCULATION:
   ‚Ä¢ How calculated: Sum of ALL order values per customer in Saudi Riyals (SAR)
   ‚Ä¢ Formula: SUM(order_total) per customer_id
   ‚Ä¢ Example: Customer B made 3 orders: 100 SAR + 200 SAR + 150 SAR = 450 SAR total
   ‚Ä¢ Range in your data: 0.21 SAR to 14461.00 SAR
   ‚Ä¢ Why it matters: High-value customers drive most of your revenue
   ‚Ä¢ Scoring: Higher spend = Higher score (5=top spender, 1=low spender)

üî¢ SCORING SYSTEM:
QUINTILE SCORING SYSTEM EXPLAINED:
   ‚Ä¢ Method: Divide all customers into 5 equal groups (quintiles) for each metric
   ‚Ä¢ Score 5: Top 20% of customers (best performers)
   ‚Ä¢ Score 4: Next 20% (above average)
   ‚Ä¢ Score 3: Middle 20% (average)
   ‚Ä¢ Score 2: Next 20% (below average)  
   ‚Ä¢ Score 1: Bottom 20% (needs attention)
   ‚Ä¢ Example: If you have 1000 customers, top 200 spenders get monetary score 5

üìà YOUR SCORE DISTRIBUTION:
------------------------------
Recency Scores:
   ‚Ä¢ Best (Score 5): 2859 customers (bought 258 days ago or less)
   ‚Ä¢ Worst (Score 1): 2793 customers (bought 473+ days ago)

Frequency Scores:
   ‚Ä¢ Best (Score 5): 2838 customers (made 2+ orders)
   ‚Ä¢ Worst (Score 1): 2838 customers (made only 1 order(s))

Monetary Scores (SAR):
   ‚Ä¢ Best (Score 5): 2838 customers (spent 1485.00 SAR+)
   ‚Ä¢ Worst (Score 1): 2838 customers (spent less than 251.30 SAR)

üíµ AVERAGE ORDER VALUE (AOV) EXPLAINED
========================================

WHAT IS AOV?
Average Order Value = Total Revenue √∑ Number of Orders
It shows how much customers spend per purchase on average.

WHY AOV MATTERS:
‚Ä¢ Higher AOV = More profit per customer visit
‚Ä¢ Easier to increase than getting new customers
‚Ä¢ Small AOV increases have big revenue impact

HOW TO INCREASE AOV:
1. Bundle products together at discount
2. Offer upsells at checkout ('Add this for $X more')
3. Set free shipping threshold above current AOV
4. Suggest complementary products
5. Create product packages or kits

YOUR CURRENT AOV: $688.88
SUGGESTED TARGET: $826.66 (20% increase)
REVENUE IMPACT: If you achieve this, revenue increases by 20%
